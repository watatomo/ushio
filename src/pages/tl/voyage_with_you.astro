A new project is introduced that has a goal of featuring each ward of HAMA individually. The Morning team are the first in the company to create a tour for this project, with Yukikaze leading as the main host and Kafka begrudgingly joining him as the subhost.

Before the tour, the team goes on their second study trip together with the destination being Kamikucho, as decided by Yukikaze! Hearing this, Kafka starts working out so he can go hiking and see the beautiful views alongside the protagonist.

Yukikaze ends up being overprotective and gets into an argument with Kafka. On top of that, he is starting to become unsure of his future as an athlete after hearing that his father wishes to quit coaching him.
