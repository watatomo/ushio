(Pedaling)

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
(I wanted to get in some early morning stretches before I left for the rink, but… someone’s already in here.)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
(Pant, pant)…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Kafka, you okay? I think you should take a break.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Urk, I can keep going… Three more minutes…
</Bubble>

(Pedaling)

<Bubble character="Renga">
Your heart rate’s at 152… That doesn’t look good. Kafka, you need to slow down!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Ugh, (pant, pant)… I-I’m done… I’m so dizzy…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Get down carefully… Um… You should do some stretches. I’ll get you water!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
……

You’re covered in sweat, Kafka. How long have you been at this?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Yukikaze…!

…You saw all of that?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
You’re pushing yourself too hard. There’s no need to go to these lengths to build your stamina.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
(Sigh)…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
……

Let’s go somewhere else for the trip. We can go somewhere closer that’s easier on y—
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Stop talking. I don’t want to be the reason why we change things.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
But I’m worried that you might collapse again.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
And I’m working out so that _doesn’t_ happen.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
You’re not suited to physical tasks. There are lots of other things you’re plenty good at, so you don’t need to force yourself.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…Why do you think you can boss me around?! Because you’re healthier and more athletic than me? You don’t know how I feel!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…! That’s not what I…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Kafka, I got you some water… Yukikaze? Wait, what’s going on? Did something happen?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
It’s nothing! Renga, give me that. I’m going to start my stretches, so help me out. Ignore the skater, he’s going to leave soon anyway.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
O-okay… Are you leaving for practice, Yukikaze? Good luck. I’ll take care of Kafka here, so don’t worry too much!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
……

(…Did I say too much? I just hate seeing Kafka push himself so hard…)
</Bubble>

<Location name="HAMA Tours - Meeting Space"/>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Kafka, how are you feeling? I heard from Renga that you were on the exercise bike for quite a while…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Ah, Sakujiro. Can you check these for me? They’re the materials for our next report to Tokyo.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro">
Of course, Mr. President. I shall have it done posthaste.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
(…He’s ignoring me again.)
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
(Yuki-nii and Kafka have been like that for a few days now… Did they have another argument? Even if they did, I wouldn’t have expected things to stay this awkward for so long.)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Looking at those two kinda makes you forget that the whole point of this thing is to help the hosts get along.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Ten-kun… Do you know what happened?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Nah, not really, but I could probably take a guess. Right, Liguang-san?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Tch, why are you involving me?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Liguang-san, you agree that things are weird between them, right?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
That idiot agreed to help Oguro work out, but I don’t expect him to know how to support him properly. No wonder Kamina’s worried.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
What? No way! I wanted this duo to be amazing… Should I try to step in and help, Boss?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…I need to go…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Yachiyo-kun, uh… Y-you have so much other work to do… Like, you need to come up with ideas for the new song, right? I don’t think anyone else but you could do that…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
(Gasp), you’re right!! I need to talk to Sakujiro-san about the outfits, too!! I’m crazy busy!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
(Yuki-nii looks so sad… I wish it was easier for him to talk through things with Kafka…)
</Bubble>

<Location name="HAMA House - Kitchen" />

<Bubble mc>
Hmm, I hope this is good… I tried to follow the recipe I found…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Thanks for handling dinner, Chief. I know you’ve already started, but let me help.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Ah, welcome home, Yuki-nii. You don’t have to, but thanks. I’m almost done anyway.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Chicken breast and broccoli…? Did Kafka ask you to make this?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Yeah. He said it’s good for fitness. I think he wanted to build up his muscles, or something?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
……

Chief, what if we changed our study trip destination? I still want to go to Taisho Pond with you, but maybe we could do that on our own time instead.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
…I mean, I’m fine with that, but… Are you doing it because of Kafka?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
You remember how he passed out during our dance lessons and ended up in the hospital. I don’t want him to push himself.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
……

I know how you feel, I’m worried, too… But don’t you think you should consider how Kafka feels about this?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
I also had a fight with Kafka because I was worried about him during those HosLive lessons.

I don’t think I was wrong for feeling the way I did, but… Kafka isn’t cooped up in the hospital anymore.

He’s trying to change himself, so I thought that I should do the same… I want to believe in him.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…Believe in Kafka…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
It’ll be fine! Everything will work itself out! That’s how it’s been for us up until now, right? I want you to believe in Kafka, too.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…You’re right. I… do feel like I’m being inconsiderate of his feelings.

I’ll try and have a talk with him.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Yeah! I’m sure it’ll go well.

Oh, and I forgot…

Could I ask you to record weekly reports until the tour’s over?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Of course… I’ll work hard if that means making you happy.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Thanks, I’m looking forward to it!
</Bubble>
