…?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze fan A">
We’re finally here! I’ve been waiting for so long. This feature tour thing is crazy; you’re telling me we get to watch a special program put on by Yukikaze?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze fan B">
It was SO hard to get a reservation… But I’m glad I spent all of that time sitting and waiting in front of my phone!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze fan C">
Of course it was hard, it’s an exclusive ice show! It’s a must-see for Yukikaze fans, and it’s practically free!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="HAMA fan A">
I was waiting for them to announce their next tour, but I didn’t expect for them to come out with these single-ward tours. HAMA always brings something new to the table.

All of the tours so far have been amazing, but since this is just for one ward, I’m half excited and half curious.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="HAMA fan C">
But if this one turns out to be really good, I’m gonna go on the next feature tour, too!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
(Wow… There are so many people… I guess everyone wanted to see Yuki-nii’s ice show. I hope they like it.)

(It’s starting…!)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Child Yukikaze">
“...(Pant, pant)... Not again.”

“...Kh…”

“I need to try again…”
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze fan A">
Huh…? What’s this?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze fan B">
Is that Yukikaze when he was a kid? What…? He couldn’t land that? There’s no way…

…I don’t really know much about skating, but… This is kind of emotional.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Child Yukikaze">
“One more, I can do this…!”

“...Ah, I got it!”
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…!
</Bubble>

(Applause)

<Bubble character="HAMA fan B">
Wow…! I can’t believe he went from failing to being able to do that…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
A single axel, and then a double.
</Bubble>

(Applause)

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Triple axel, and a quadruple salchow…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="HAMA fan C">
Wow… The jumps are getting higher.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze fan C">
Yu-Yukikazeeeeee… I’m falling in love…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
“Thank you all for coming. There’s something I wanted to tell you today…”

“As long as you don’t give up, you’ll find that sight you want to see one day.”

“This is a program I put together with that thought in mind. Please enjoy.”
</Bubble>

(Applause)

<Bubble character="Announcer">
“Thank you for attending the show today. We will soon be handing out bentos with shumai that Kafka and I came up with. We’ve set aside 30 minutes for all guests to enjoy them in the arena. Until then…”
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze fan A">
(Sigh), that was amazing. I totally cried. I can’t believe we’re gonna get Yukikaze’s homemade shumai on top of that ♪
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze fan B">
(Sob).... I’m feeling so much right now that I can’t even explain it…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="HAMA fan A">
Ward 0 Mayor Kafka helped him come up with these?! They’re so fancy!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="HAMA fan B">
Ten-chamu handed it to me… Oh, my God, I have to post about this on Spinet.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="HAMA fan C">
I’m super happy with what we’ve already seen, but there’s even more after this, right? Woah, the shumai has nozawana in it. It’s so tingly-feeling and tasty!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
……

(The mood here is completely different compared to when I was working as mayor… Yukikaze… You’ve grown so fast that you’ve surpassed me without me noticing…)

(He’ll be fine even without me…)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Dad… I’m glad you came.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
…! Yukikaze.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Can you… come with me?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
…? But your tour’s still going.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I have some free time while everyone’s eating. It’s not far, so… please.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
…F-fine.
</Bubble>

<Location name="Sorimachi Park" />

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
Why are we at the park?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
After the guests are done eating, they’re going to come outside in the order stated on their apps and walk on a path around here. It’s meant to be a moment for them to look into their futures.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
Looking into the future…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Dad, I want you to help me with the final check.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Announcer">
“Now starting the Yukikaze Feature Tour’s Future Walk.”
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
What…?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
It’s a life-sized hologram of me. It’ll explain the walk for you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hologram Yukikaze">
“Thank you for coming here today. While you walk down this path, I’ll be asking you about your future goals and one companion you’d like to bring with you to achieve them.”

It’ll continue as you keep walking.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
…The hologram walks, too? It’s like there are two of you…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Haha, Kafka and Nayuki are incredibly talented. It looks just like the real thing.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hologram Yukikaze">
“I want you to look forward to your future. To do that, let’s decide on some long-term, mid-term, and short-term goals together.”

“Your goal can be anything, from wanting to become president to wanting to eat some tomatoes—whatever makes you excited for your future. Let’s start with the long-term goal.”
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
You tap here to record your long-term goal. Mine is…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
To win gold at the Olympics.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hologram Yukikaze">
“‘Win gold at the Olympics?’ Got it. Good job on choosing a goal.”
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
Gold, huh…? I’m sure you can do it.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Mm. Thank you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hologram Yukikaze">
“Next is your mid-term goal. It can be something that’s on the way to your long-term goal, or something completely unrelated. If you’re not sure, you can ask me for help.”
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…I’m sure enough. My mid-term goal is to win the JPN Championship and be considered to represent the country at the Olympics.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hologram Yukikaze">
“Got it.”
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
…As long as you work with your new coach to practice your expressiveness, it’ll happen. He has a track record of creating winning athletes, unlike me…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
……
</Bubble>

—TIMESKIP

<Bubble character="Hologram Yukikaze">
“The walk’s almost over. Let’s decide on a short-term goal.”
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
My short-term goal is… To improve expressiveness, so I can score high in performance…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
…Your new coach will—
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
While working hand-in-hand with my dad.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hologram Yukikaze">
“...Mm, that’s a good goal. Looks like you have a lot to look forward to.”

“For our last moments together, I want you to decide on a companion who will witness you achieve your goals. If you can’t think of someone, any of us in R1ze would be glad to accompany you.”
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Hah, that’s funny. I’m in there, too, but if I choose one of the mayors…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hologram Liguang">
“I’m Lu Liguang, Ward 4 mayor. I may be strict on you, but I intend to see things through until the end. Keep that in mind if you want to choose me.”
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hologram Ten">
“Who cares about all of that ‘goal’ stuff? It’s too hard. Just take it easy. Start by relaxing your shoulders a bit for me.”
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hologram Kafka">
“I can give you advice if you choose me. We can start by planning out a roadmap towards your goals.”
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hologram Renga">
“I see you chose me… Hmm, I guess you’re interesting. Don’t let anybody besides me see you like this, got it?”
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
Th-this is amazing…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I think so, too. But for me…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hologram Yukikaze">
“Have someone in mind? This is the person who’s going to be by your side when you look out across that view you’re dreaming of.”
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…I do. I… choose my Dad, Kamina Sadayuki.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
…Yukikaze…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hologram Yukikaze">
“I got everything down. I hope you can make it to that view you want to see someday.”
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Dad, do you remember the time I jumped my first axel?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
…O-of course, I do. I was so…!

I was so… happy.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…Remember how you told me that I could land quads? That I could win gold? Because you believed in me, I had faith in myself, too.

I still want to focus on my expressiveness, but I don’t want to do it just for winning medals. It’s related to a goal of mine that’s still many years ahead of me.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
…I see.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I’m not going to give up on competing. If that new coach is willing to teach me, I’ll gladly accept.

But… I don’t want you to leave me, Dad. My greatest goal right now is to win gold at the Olympics, and when I do…

You’re the only person I want next to me at the kiss and cry…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
…Yu-Yukikaze.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Dad, would you keep coaching me…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
……

…I-I want to be there next to you, too…

B-but are you sure you’re okay with me…? I…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
There’s nobody else I’d want there more than you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
…I… I’ll put in the work… so I can be by your side… I can change…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Mm. I know you can… Dad.
</Bubble>
