…With all that said, cheers to a successful first feature tour!
</Bubble>

(Clink)

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Cheers.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
This was the first of many ♪
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
You both did well… I-if you want, I can give you shoulder massages!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Booze tastes better after a good success story.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
I was taking a look at the guest data. There are definitely more repeat visitors compared to our first round of tours.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Liguang! Don’t talk about work when we’re trying to celebrate! Anyway, our hiking trip was pretty fun!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…I’m surprised you found it fun when you were trembling in fear over bears the entire time.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Wha…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Hiking felt great. I’d like to try trekking next time ♪
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Trekking… Ugh…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
In that case, I can come up with another training regimen for you, Kafka.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Oh, I’m glad you mentioned that. I’m asking Sakujiro and Daniel to do that next time.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Wh-why…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I only listened to you this time because I was your subhost. It was an exception.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
E-evwybody!! I finally have the data on how many people chose the mayors as their companions! I-I’ll annoushe them!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
(…! This was for people who didn’t have anyone in mind to be their companion! It might give us some insight into what to do for our future tours…)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
In first place is… shivershivershivershiver…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Yachiyo, are you adding in sound effects?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
The Ice Prince, Yukikaze-san!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Woah. Well, that makes sense.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Some of the comments include “I felt a lot of hope after seeing the videos of him as a kid,” and “he worked so hard and never gave up. I want him to follow me towards my own goals!”
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I’m not surprised. I felt the same after watching the projection…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Umm, second place is President Oguro, third is Liguang-san, fourth is Ten-kun, and fifth is Renga-san…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Oh, I’m in second? That’s great to hear. I guess a lot of people are looking for advice.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
I expected that. I guess Liguang-san attracted all of the people who wanted to be treated strictly, and I got all of the people who wanted to be treated loosely.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
I remember that the younger Shiramitsu from the Night Team helped us think of our lines. He mentioned something about an… “otome game?”
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
But they were all things we would actually say anyway.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I-I’m last… But I made sure to go into Toi’s script and fix it up to make it even better…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
That’s weird… Those types of lines were popular in the shojo manga that we researched together…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Hmm, maybe I should’ve gone in harder on the egotistical thing?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
(Well, if they just went with Toi’s script as-is, I’m sure it would’ve suited Renga-kun better and more people would’ve chosen him… But I can’t tell them that…)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Grrr… dammit! I thought I’d do better than Liguang! I need a drink!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Chief.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Good work on everything, Yuki-nii. And congrats on being the most popular pick. That must mean that a lot of people understood what you were trying to convey.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Thanks. I… was able to talk with my dad properly this time. I’m happy about that.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Oh, right, we were all so busy that I didn’t get the chance to ask. What did you two talk about?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Ahh… Well, actually… Haha…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
What is it? Why are you laughing?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Well, my dad told me about the reason why he was able to jump his first axel… When he was young, he fell in love with my mom who was taking lessons with him, and he wanted to show off in front of her…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
…!

That’s so cute…! Uncle Sadayuki was in love with her for that long? I guess she was his motivation to keep skating!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…Like father, like son.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Haha, yeah. I’m glad to hear that you’re on good terms now.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Oh, before I forget…

This tour went well, and I was able to talk things through with my dad… All thanks to you, <Name first /> … So…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Woahwoahwoahwoah, WAY too close. Stop holding hands. And stop looking at each other like that.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Wah, Kafka… Don’t scare me like that.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Can you cut it out, Chief? You two should <em>not</em> be that close.
</Bubble>

(Thud)

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Huhhh? Did I do sum’n’…? Woah, issa gold nugget… Iss all goooold…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Yachiyooo… Stoooop… (Sob, sniff, sniff)… That’s… Thassa tanuki disguised as a leaf… (Sob)… Don’t… Don’t hurt the tanuki…!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
(Huh? Ah, Yachiyo-kun dumped the emergency water bottle into Renga-kun and they’re both drunk and hugging each other!)

Yuki-nii, thanks for the cassette tape! I’m gonna go take care of all of that!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Kafka, about the tour…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Ugh, you don’t need to tell me. I know what you’re about to say.

You want to thank me and tell me that I left a huge impression on you. You can say it, but for your information, I didn’t do any of it for your sake.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
That’s true, but…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
……

I guess I’m thankful, too. You helped me walk to Taisho Pond.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…!

I’m glad we had “Chiimon” there with us…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I have no idea what that is. Why do you always go off into weird directions like that?

…Well, should we make a toast? Just this once.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Yeah… Here’s to a job well done, Kafka.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Phew… Our afterparty was so fun. It was a little chaotic with Renga-kun and Yachiyo-kun being drunk, though…

Okay… Let’s listen to Yuki-nii’s tape.
</Bubble>

(Click)

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
“<Name first /> … I’m so happy I can talk to you through this cassette tape. I’ve always felt a little jealous seeing you exchange tapes with Kafka when we were all kids.”
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
(Yuki-nii… I didn’t realize…!)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
“Everything was a great experience, from the study trip to today. I was glad to work with Kafka, since he usually doesn’t give me the time of day.”

“…He’s amazing. I truly respect him.”
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
(I think Kafka might feel the same way about Yuki-nii. Although he’d never admit it.)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
“…To be honest, I never would’ve thought that I could be this involved in the tourism industry.”

“If HAMA Tours didn’t exist… I’d still be listening to my dad’s every command while keeping my true feelings buried. I wouldn’t have been able to do anything as mayor.”

“…If I stayed like that, I think my heart would’ve started withering away. My future would’ve been completely dark.”
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
(Yuki-nii…)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
“There are a lot of things about my future that I’m not sure of, but I’m still excited for it. I was thinking that it proves how much my life has changed for the better. Am I wrong?”
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
…No, Yuki-nii. You’re right.

(I’m so happy to hear that he has hope for his future.)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
“I want to put my all into both my skating and my duties as mayor… But when my life as a competing athlete comes to an end…”

“I want you to bring me to that place you promised to take me to.”
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
(I will, Yuki-nii)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
“…Until then, keep watching over me.”
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
(…Yeah, of course. I always have, and I always will…)
</Bubble>
