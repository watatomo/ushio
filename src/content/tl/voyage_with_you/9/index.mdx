<Bubble character="Liguang">
What exactly does that entail?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Okay. I know our study trip was just a few days ago, but…

Yukikaze’s all done with his idea for the tour concept, so I’ll have him pitch it to everyone today. And for the record, I helped him ♪
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
(I’m excited to see how he’s going to bring what he talked about at Matsumoto Castle to life…!)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Yukikaze, as your leader, I’ll make sure to give you advice. So go ahead and give us what you got!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
I sincerely doubt that you’ll be able to give any useful advice.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
HUH?! Why are you always coming at me like that?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
It’d be cool if he could include some kinda snack in there that goes well with booze.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
The duo’s concept will be decided… based on this meeting… I’m so excited!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Thank you for your time today, everyone. I’ve settled on what I want to convey with this tour.

The Ward 2 feature tour concept will be… “a reflection on your future and finding the view you want to see with someone.”
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…??
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Kinda vague.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
The main event of the tour will be my ice show. But before the show itself, I want to project a collection of my skating practice from my childhood inside the building

Among them will be visuals of me failing my jumps and then succeeding them for the first time. I plan on ending the projection show with a short performance that begins with simple jumps and progresses to include more advanced ones.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
So you intend to go into the main ice show after that? It all sounds very artistic. Although the concept is abstract, I think the audience will understand if you express it well enough.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Your fans will go insane over that footage of you as a kid.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Wow, wow, wow… Th-this is amazing…! W-will we be able to take pictures of the projection show…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Hm… I think it sounds great! People already love your ice shows, Yukikaze…

But are you planning on doing quads? I-isn’t that dangerous? I watched a video about figure skating, and they said that there usually aren’t many jumps like that during ice shows…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Renga… I’ll be fine. Thanks for the concern.

I’ll be jumping salchows, which I’m most confident in, so I think I can handle it. I hope watching my jumps will leave the audience members feeling encouraged, even if it’s just a little bit.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
There’s gonna be food there, right?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Of course. I’m thinking of making shumai exclusive for this tour. I’d like for everyone to help me hand them out.

That aside, what I really want to do for this tour will happen afterwards. After everyone watches the show and enjoys their shumai… I want to do something special in the park just outside of the rink.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Something special…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Yeah. Using our app, I want to come up with some long-term, mid-term, and short-term goals with everyone. I also want our guests to choose a “companion” that will accompany them on their journey and act as a witness for achieving those goals.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Hmmm…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
It’s not a bad idea, but there may be guests who either don’t have goals or don’t know someone who would accompany them. I don’t think they’d be particularly interested.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Oh, you’re right… That could happen…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
But you have an idea to solve that, right?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I do. The word “goal” may seem intimidating, but it’s just any hope you have for the future. So even small goals would count.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Then I guess a long-term goal could be something like wanting to go to your favorite idol’s concert next year.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
My goal is to see all of the teams film culinary videos and have pajama parties… And to photograph them after they get up in the morning… It’s a must-have for idol photobooks…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
If there’s anyone who doesn’t have a companion in mind, they can just choose one of us. They can pick us from the app…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
One of us?! What does that mean?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
We’ll record voice messages of us cheering our guests on so that they can listen to us while they’re making progress towards their goals.

I think it would make them happy to be encouraged by someone on our team every day…

If everyone can help me with this, I’d be grateful.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…I’m not the encouraging type.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…That’s not a bad thing. I’m sure there are lots of people who would work harder if they listened to someone awful and mean like you. As for me… I’ll cheer them on in my own classy celebrity style!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Well, recording some voice messages isn’t that much work. I’ll do it.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
There you have it, Yukikaze.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…Thank you, everyone. You’re all a great help.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I’ll be in charge of overseeing the development of those app features.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I… feel like I’m asking for too much.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Well, it *is *on short notice, so we won’t have a lot of time to run tests on it. It’s certainly not the norm.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…I’m sorry. Is it out of the question?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
……

Not at all. It’ll be easy work. After all, we have Nayuki on our side. We’ll make it in time; this is <em>me</em> we’re talking about.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…! I see. I’ll put my faith in you. Thank you, Kafka.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
(Wow… They’re working together so much better than before! Everyone has really gotten closer…)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
(Gasp), I forgot!

Grandmaster unlove, also known as Nanamegi-kun, has told me that he’d love to take commissions for hoslive duet songs!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Oh, right, we need to figure that out. Yuki-nii and Kafka will be featured on the song this time, so… What kind of song do you guys want?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I want to dance more than I did last time, since I have more stamina now… I’m sure you want to see me looking cool on stage, right, Chief?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Ah, yeah. But I’m sure the guests would love to see you no matter what you look like. I feel the same…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Instead of a dance-heavy song, I’d like a ballad that I could use for my ice shows. If it could have some classical influence…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Why are you deciding everything on your own?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I think a ballad would suit you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Chief, what do you think?! You’ll choose me, right?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
No, you’ll go with me, right, [Kaede/Momiji]?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Huh? Uh, why are both of you so close…? And why are you holding onto my arms…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
…Couldn’t you just make a song kinda like that? Like you’re competing for the audience’s attention.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
What…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Y’know, like two princes fighting over someone. It’s a pretty common romance trope.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Oh! I know a drama like that! It’s called “Caught Between Two Princes!”
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
“2Prince?!” That show’s sooooo cute! The actors who play the princes are the coolest…!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Yeah, that’s the one! It’s big in the industry, too. My manager asked me why I couldn’t be that noble and prince-like … Ugh, I wanted to forget about that…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
President Oguro and Yukikaze are gonna be princes fighting for my attention?!?! This is crazy…!! I feel like a young maiden in love!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…That is <em>deeply</em> unpleasant.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro">
In that case, I will be sure to make your costumes prince-like. I can include references to Kamikochi by incorporating botanical motifs…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Agh! Sakujiro, you scared me popping out like that…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
(Yeah, where on earth did he come from…?)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Ahhhhh, this is amazing!! To go along with the concept, the lyrics of the song should be elegant, but not overly flowery…

I’m…!! I’m gonna write up a proposal and send it to Grandmaster unlove right away! I gotta go work on this, so excuse me!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…I guess it’s all settled.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
……

Fine with me. Just so you know, I won’t lose to you, even in this song.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I know. I won’t hold back, either.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
(...I wonder how this will turn out.)
</Bubble>
