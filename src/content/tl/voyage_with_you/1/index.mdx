(Land the jump into a spread eagle… Then a change of edge from inward in time with the music.)

(And for the last spin, I need to keep my balance…)

(Pant, pant)...

(My sit spin posture isn’t quite right… and I need more height on my jumps. With the Grand Prix coming up, I’d like to focus on improving my precision.)

Dad, can I ask you for some feedback?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Dad?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
Ah, of course. I think that what you have so far is more than good enough. As long as you continue to fine-tune things, you won’t run into any problems.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…Could I have some advice on my jumps?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
Well… They’re fine. I don’t have much else to say.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
……

(He’s been like this ever since I told him that I wanted to work on my expressiveness. I did tell him that I wanted to come up with my own practice regimen, but I made sure to emphasize that I still wanted to hear him out.)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
Ahh… I just remembered, there’s something I wanted to tell you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…? What is it?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
…I know you mentioned wanting to focus on expressiveness, but… I’m not the best at teaching that, so…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
…Well, I intend to find you a new coach.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…A… new coach?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
There’s one from overseas who also handles choreography. We haven’t closed the deal yet, but he was very interested when I talked to him about it… I want him to teach you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
Ah, don’t worry, you won’t be moving overseas. He’ll be flying in to work with you. And… you already know him, so I’m sure you’ll get along. He can do a lot of things I can’t…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…I’m not saying that I disagree with your choice or your way of thinking but… What will happen to you?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
Me? …Ah, well…

……

There’s… not much left for me to do before the Olympics start. So I might retire as a coach after this season… That was my plan.

D-don’t worry about me, it’ll all work out. Your skating should be at the forefront of your mind right now.

Just as you said, as long as you work on your expressiveness, you could score well for performance at the Olympics and have a high chance at winning gold. You should do everything for those medals.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…You’re not going to coach me anymore so I have a better chance at winning gold?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
W-well, yes, that’s about right… I suppose.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
Th-that aside! I think it’s about time you finish for today and start your cool down.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…Dad’s not going to coach me anymore…

(I would’ve never expected him to think that way. I’m happy that he went out of his way to find a new coach for me, but… Is this really what I wanted?)

(I want to improve on my expressiveness. I want to find my own skating style. Those were the only two things I wanted when I confronted Dad, so I thought he would continue coaching me…)

(Should I just let things happen…? I don’t know what I should do.)

<Location name="HAMA Tours - Meeting Space"/>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Oh, I see. In that case…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Yukikaze, are you listening?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
(Gasp)... I’m sorry. I spaced out for a bit.

(I’m supposed to be in a meeting, but I keep thinking about Dad…)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Space out on your own time, not on company time.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Kafka, don’t be mean. Yuki-nii, are you okay? You never get distracted like that during conversations…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I’m alright. You can continue.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Okay, I’ll say it again for a certain someone who wasn’t listening.

Our next mission as a company will be to enliven each ward one by one.

I call it a “feature tour!”
