<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Everyone looks tired from running. Let’s take a break.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
(Pant, pant)... Yuki-nii didn’t even break a sweat… That’s a pro athlete for you.)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I’m gonna… take a seat here… Phew…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
I might throw up… Urggh…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
(Pant, pant)... We… We lost the bear, right?

Wait, what? Liguang isn’t here!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Oh, you’re right.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
D-did Boss get eaten by the bear?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
There’s no way! Wh-what do we do? I should’ve put some bells on him…!!

(Rustling)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Hyah! Did the bear find us?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Passing Monkey">
Ook?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…A monkey? Th-then was that just…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
It’s the same monkey we saw earlier.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
That’s why I said this is ridiculous.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Wh… Liguang, you’re finally here! Did you walk the entire way?!

You didn’t get eaten… That’s good…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Why on earth would a _monkey_ eat me?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Hey, Yachiyo! It wasn’t even a bear!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
I-I was wrong?! I-I’m so sorryyyyyy!! I can only atone with my death… I need a bear to eat me!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Ah, no, I didn’t mean to put all of the blame on you…! I started running, too… Sorry…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Well, it’s good that it was a false alarm. Chief, you bought a bunch of snacks from the store back there, right? We should eat some of it.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Oh, yeah! I got some oyaki and kappa-yaki, so everyone can have some.

Here, everyone take your pick!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Nagano oyaki… There are a lot of different fillings… Nozawana and eggplant… Even daikon.

Th-the kappa-yaki is so cuuuute… I know beggars can’t be choosers, but can I have that one?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Can I take one, too? …Mm.

I-it’s so good…! What’s in this thing?! It tastes homemade…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
(The kappa-yaki tastes great, too…! Eating out in nature like this makes everything feel so special.)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Kafka, do you wanna try the eggplant one?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…Huh? Oh, sure. It’s great. I’m really looking forward to dinner tonight, by the way. What were we having again?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Yachiyo-kun made a reservation for us somewhere. Since we’re in Nagano… Maybe it’s a soba place?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Heheh… You expect too little of me, Chief. Our reservation’s for a restaurant called “M’Nagano,” where they have not just soba, but also horse-meat sashimi and sanzoku-yaki, too!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
They have all of that?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Says on Grublog that M’Nagano has a 0.01-star rating.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Huh?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Looking at the restaurant’s website… The owner seems to be quite eccentric.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
(O-oh, yeah… He’s wearing a towel as a headband and cutting mincemeat with a giant knife… And it’s covered in blood… It says “Only fellas who can savor m’flavor are welcome here…”)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Y-yikes… Are we really gonna be eating here? I haven’t been to such a… <em>wild</em> place ever since the Nishizonos took me in, so…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
It says “No same-day cancellations. If you do so, I will chase you until the ends of the earth.”
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
…I guess we gotta go.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
H-hyahhhh, I’msorryI’msorry!! I-I think a demon must have possessed me and forced me to make this reservation! I promise I’ll get it exorcized next tiiiiime!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Haha… I’m glad we looked them up. But that aside, should we get going now?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…Yeah! We should get outta here before any bears show up!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
(Hm? What’s going on with Kafka…?)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
……

Kafka, I’m going to take off your shoes and socks.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
…! Kafka, you have a cut on your ankle! When did you… Wait, did you get it when you tripped?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…! Won’t it be hard for him to walk? If he does, his shoe will keep rubbing against it.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…Now’s the time to turn back if we need to. We haven’t walked that far yet.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
It’s because I ran off… I’m sorry, Kafka…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Stop, it isn’t all that bad. I can still walk. Could you let go of my leg now, Yukikaze?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…No.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
!

Let… go!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…Yachiyo, can you hand me a water bottle?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Eh, uh, o-okay!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
……Tsk.

(Water pouring)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Does it sting? Sorry, you’ll have to bear with the pain for a bit.

The cut isn’t too deep, so applying some pressure on the clean wound should stop the bleeding. A bandage will prevent it from drying out, so it’ll heal quicker. I just need to wrap it well so it doesn’t slip off…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…What’s up with these bandaids and the tape? They have some weird mascot printed all over them.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Ah, is that the limited-time merch from mascot idol Chiimon?!?! S-so cute…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
You know them? These were souvenirs I got from Chihiro when he went to Beppu. I’m glad I brought them just in case.

They look cute, but they also work well… Done. Let me know if the bandage falls off. You should be able to walk now.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Alright, we’re all ready to go.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
(Yuki-nii… I didn’t expect that. I thought he would forbid Kafka from continuing…)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…Are you worried about Kafka, Chief?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Ah, yeah… He got hurt, after all.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
He’ll be alright. He should be able to make it to Taisho Pond. If anything happens, I’ll carry him.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I never asked you to do that. I have no intention of letting you carry me.

Okay, let’s go! Chief! Let’s try and be the first ones there!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…Hah, go ahead.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
…!

(Yuki-nii really believes in Kafka now… That makes me happy!)
</Bubble>

<Location name="Nagano, Kamikochi - Taisho Pond" />

<Bubble mc>
We made it to Taisho Pond! Wooow… It’s gorgeous! This is amazing…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
You can see the mountains reflected in the water… Woah…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Everything around us is huge… I’m getting kind of emotional…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Yeah, really makes you feel connected to nature.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Kamikochi… Some people call it “the land where gods descend.” The view suits that name.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Does that mean God’s here right now?! I need to make a wish… No more debt, no more debt… Muttermuttermutter…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
(I’m glad to see that everyone’s enjoying the destination I chose.)

(Especially Chief and Kafka…)
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Kafka, you did so well. All of that training paid off.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Stop, I’m not a kindergartener. You know that I always do things once I put my mind to them.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Yeah, but… It almost feels like a dream to be here with you… We only ever saw each other in the hospital for the longest time.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…I feel the same.

I’ve always wanted to walk with you and see sights like this, [Kaede/Momiji]-chan. That’s why I want to work so hard.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Heheh, I’m glad I told you about all of those scenic spots!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…Will you come with me to see all of them, too?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Of course! Let’s go to every single one!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Those two are off in their own little world. You okay with that, Yukikaze-san?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Hm? Well, yeah, this is what Kafka wanted. I’m happy for him.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Yeah, it’s really nice to set a goal and end up learning how to do things you couldn’t do before!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
I don’t think you’d ever do the learning part.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Whazzat?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
(Doing things you couldn’t do before…)
</Bubble>

<Flashback start />

<Bubble character="Sadayuki">
It’s alright! Be brave and jump!

I know you can do it. Even if you don’t believe in yourself, I’ll always believe in you. Because you’re my…
</Bubble>

<Flashback end />
