<Location name="Nagano, Kamikochi - Taisho Pond Bridge" />

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Hm… The whole hike took us about three hours. We’re right on schedule. The bus should be coming soon.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I’m so tired…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Kafka, hang in there! We’re having dinner soon!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Yeah, that’s the problem.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I forgot about that… If we leave anything on the plate, the owner might slit our throats.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Glooooom… If he asks for volunteers, I, Fuefuki Yachiyo, will gladly sacrifice myself…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
W-well, it’ll be alright. We’ll have plenty of free time tomorrow, so even if our dinner isn’t the greatest, we can enjoy the local cuisine then…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Oh, I wanted to talk about everyone’s itinerary in my weekly report, so can I ask where everyone's heading?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Mm, I’m gonna be in Togakushi. I got some business to take care of.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Ten, you’re going to Togakushi…? Well, I get it, you have work to do.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
I’m planning on taking a ferry at Lake Suwa for research.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Huh?! You, too?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Well, I guess… I don’t mind going on the ferry w-with you…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Tell me when you’re going, so I can avoid you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Why are you always like this?! You can handle being on a ferry with me for a few lousy minutes!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
What about you, Kafka?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Chief and I are going to Matsumoto Castle! We promised each other to see it together a while ago, right?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Yeah. Where are you headed, Yuki-nii?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…Hakuba… But I wanted to spend the day with you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
That’s where they held the Winter Olympics, right?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Right. I’m going to the ski jumping stadium. I was hoping I could get some inspiration there for the tour and for my competitions…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
That sounds like a great idea!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Yeah, but…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
……

They light up Matsumoto Castle at night.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I’m probably going straight to bed after dinner tomorrow to preserve my stamina. If the two of you still have energy by then, how about you go there with Chief?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…Are you sure? You usually wouldn’t want the two of us to be alone together…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Well I’m gonna have Chief all to myself for most of the day anyway. I don’t mind giving you that little sliver of time. But only if our chief wants to go with you!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Kafka… My dear little brother… I’m so happy.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Again, I have no recollection of us being brothers.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
(Kafka… He’s probably trying to thank Yuki-nii for helping him today since he was able to keep walking with us. He just can’t be honest about it…)

(We ran into a little bit of trouble, but I’m glad we came to Kamikochi!)
</Bubble>

<Location name="Nagano, Matsumoto Castle" />

<Bubble mc>
Wow, the castle’s pretty during the day, but it’s so magical at night!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
It’s really cool. I’m glad I got to see it.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Kafka was having so much fun this afternoon! Getting to see castles really makes you excited.

Apparently, it’s considered a National Treasure since it’s oldest castle still standing with five external floors and six internal stories, and. The contrast between the black and white parts of the wall is really eye-catching. I also heard that they covered the wood flooring with black lacquer to make it waterproof…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I see. You sure know a lot.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Ah, I went into tour guide mode… That’s kind of embarrassing, I’m sorry.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Don’t be, I like that about you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
You’re always pampering me like that… Oh, look, you can see the castle reflected on the moat! It’s so pretty!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
……

Yuki-nii, is there something on your mind?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…You could tell?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Yeah. You’ve been thinking about something ever since we got here, right? Does it have to do with the reason why you wanted to go to Nagano?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…I can never hide anything from you…

To tell you the truth… My dad told me he wanted to quit being my coach and that he’s found a new one for me from overseas.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Huh, is that… Is that because you confronted him that one time? You talked about wanting to change how you practice.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…That might be part of it, but not the main reason. My dad seems to think that he can’t teach me expressiveness.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
When he was still competing, he wanted programs with lots of difficult jumps, but as a result, he struggled with improving his performance scores. His skating style is one that mainly focuses on jumps.

He wanted to respect my goals for my own style and found a new coach for me, but…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Are you okay with Uncle Sadayuki quitting, Yuki-nii?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I’m… not sure. I’ve been hung up over it. I don’t know what I want.

I don’t know what kind of sights I want to see, and who I want to see them with…

But when I saw how determined Kafka was to see Taisho Pond with you on this trip… I remembered something.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
…What was it?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
The day I landed my first axel.

Do you remember it, too?
</Bubble>
