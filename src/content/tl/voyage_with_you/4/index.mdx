(Pedaling)

<Bubble character="Kafka">
(Phew… My heart rate’s getting high again. Should I crank up the resistance?)
</Bubble>

(Door opens)

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Kafka, do you have a moment?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…What? Why are you here?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Renga asked me to help. He’s out today for an early morning shoot, so he wanted me to take his place.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…Are you kidding me, Renga? Ugh…

…You have something you wanted to talk about, right? Before you say anything, I’m not going to stop working out.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I… didn’t come here to say that. Chief told me that I should believe in you…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Our chief said that?

Fine, let’s talk. I’m the one who wanted the main host and subhost of the feature tours to get closer. I’ll hear you out.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
……

I don’t mind if you want to work out, but… I don’t understand why you’re pushing yourself this hard. You can still see Taisho Pond, even if you can’t walk all the way there.

Maybe you won’t pass out like before, but I’m still worried that you might be hospitalized. Do you… not feel that way?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…This body scares me more than it does anyone else…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Isn’t that obvious? …Every time I think that I’m feeling better, my health takes a nosedive. I constantly have to start back from square one.

I can’t improve my stamina overnight, it’s more like I take two steps back for every three steps forward. And that sucks… It makes me angry at myself.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
In that case…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Isn’t it the same with skating?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I’m sure you didn’t come out of the womb being able to make those jumps. You have to fail over and over before learning to land one, but just getting one right doesn’t mean that you’ve perfected them, so you have to keep trying.

Am I wrong?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
No… You’re very right.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
If you had something that you really wanted to do, but everyone around you said that you couldn’t do it, would you just accept that and give up?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
(Something I really want to do… That makes me think about my skating. I told Dad that I wanted to skate in my own style, even if it didn’t directly lead me to any wins.)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…When I was in the hospital, I kept hearing stories about our chief’s travels. So it was always on my mind…

I wanted us to travel together. After I got better, I’d walk on my own two feet and see the same sights Chief did.

…If I didn’t have those thoughts, I wouldn’t be working this hard. I don’t think I would’ve even gone through with the surgery.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…Kafka…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I want to walk to Taisho Pond and look out at the scenery with Chief. If I can’t even do that, it almost feels like I don’t know what I should be living for.

People tell me that I'll have more chances even after I give up, but I don’t believe them. Being in the hospital made me realize that… second chances are rare. So I can’t afford to give up.

You feel the same way, right? There’s something you want to see with somebody, and you want to get there on your own.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…Something I want to see…

(...Dad… The first time I landed a single axel, he smiled wider than I’d ever seen before. Since then, he always told me over and over that I could land any jump I wanted to.)

…When I was a kid, I wanted to see the view from the top of the podium.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Oh, really?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
(But it wasn’t because I wanted gold… I just wanted to see Dad smile.)

(He believed in me… I wanted to show him I could do it…)

(If I think about it, life is just like skating competitions. If you waste your time thinking there will always be another chance, you’ll never win any medals…)

…Okay, I get it now!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Huh, what do you get?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Give me some time. I’ll come up with a training regimen. I know your height, weight, and muscle mass from Sakujiro…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
What? Ew, ew, ew, what’s with that big data table? Huh? What are you doing?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I’m done. It’s a workout routine made just for you. I’ll also be in charge of your meals from now on.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…Uh… I didn’t ask you. And the routine’s so long that it’s kind of scaring me.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I’ll work hard so you can see the sights you want to see. I’ve decided to put my faith in those feelings of yours.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
……

(Sigh), fine. I guess I have to listen to what the main host says.
</Bubble>

<Location name="HAMA House - Dining Room" />

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Uuuuwahhh, what a picture-perfect Japanese meal…!! Is this charity for the poor…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
That’s a lotta dishes. Crazy amount of ingredients, too. Veggies, fish, and… beans. It’s all healthy stuff.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Yuki-nii handled a lot of the cooking for today. Everything’s really good, so enjoy.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Kafka’s meals need to have a good macronutrient ratio. He especially needs to take in high-quality protein.

But instead of building muscle mass, it’s important that he focuses on staying in good health. That’s why I cooked all of this.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Meals should be balanced first and foremost. It’s the best way to go about them.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Kafka, you should be taking in 2000 calories a day for now. Do your best to eat all of the share that I put aside for you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Okayyy…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
You’ve got a great coach now! Good for you, Kafka!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I just need to eat everything here, right? It’s not all that heavily seasoned, so that shouldn’t be too hard…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Hold on. This isn’t enough if you want to build your stamina in such a short amount of time. But it’s also not good to eat too much. That’s why I made this…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Ugh, th-that looks disgusting…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
It’s my Yukikaze-style strength-building shake. I included all of the nutrients that you’ll need along with lots of protein. Give it a try.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
The color is crazy… I try not to leave food on my plate when I eat, but I dunno about this…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Don’t worry, I also took the flavor into account!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Huhhh? It doesn’t look like you did…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Kafka… G-good luck.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Mmm, if you say so, Chief… (Gulp)...

…Huh? Wh-what?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Ka-Kafka, are you okay?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I guess, but… Wait, why does it kind of taste like a teriyaki burger…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I made it taste that way so you’d like it. Does that make it easier to drink?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Uh, well, I like the taste, but… It’s kind of gross to drink a teriyaki burger…

Ugh, but fine. I’m going to chug it!

(Gulp)... (Gulp)... Pwah. There, all done!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Woah, nice one, Prez.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Kafka, you’re amazing…!

Hey, guys, let’s all start working out with him! We’re all going to Kamikochi anyway!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Huh…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
I don’t need to.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
What are you talking about, Liguang?! Just come to the gym with us! We gotta get that morning workout in!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
…Ten… You’re gonna come with us, too, right?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Uhhh… Lemme think…

Oh, I got it. Maybe Yachiyo-san could bring over anyone who doesn’t show up in the morning.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Ack!

I-i-i-if that will help… Huh? Wait, does this mean I can legally admire everyone’s beautiful sleeping faces…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
You hear that, Liguang-san?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Murakumo, you…

(Sigh), fine. I just need to show up, right?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Awesome! Kafka, we’re gonna make this the best hike ever!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
(Now that Yuki-nii’s handling Kafka’s training, everything’s turning around… I’m excited for this trip!)
