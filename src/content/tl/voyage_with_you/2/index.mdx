<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Feature… tour?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Let me explain. The first tours each team led were hard to prepare, right? So that’s why we won’t be moving on to our second tours for a while.

But we can’t lose the fans we already made. Many people have also answered in our surveys that they’d like to collect more honorary citizen titles soon.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Ah! R-really?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Good for you, Renga-san.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Ten…! Th-thanks. I-I’m so happy that people like the program I came up with…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Mhm, I think you might be a genius.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…(Sigh), Oguro, keep going.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
To put it simply, I’d like to create and conduct smaller tour packages in between our large ones.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
And by “smaller,” you mean tours limited to just one ward?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I’m so glad that you catch onto things fast, Liguang ♪

The idea is to feature one ward and advertise its best qualities. That’s why I call it a feature tour.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Only one ward, huh… Doesn’t that mean all the work’s gonna land on one mayor?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Not exactly. I don’t intend on making only one mayor handle everything. The featured ward will have its mayor as the main host, and one other mayor can help them as a subhost.

That makes the tour a collaboration between two mayors. Of course, since we’re all members of the Morning team, I also expect the other mayors to be open to helping.

Also, I’m thinking that the song for the hoslive should be a duet between the two mayors. That’ll keep things fresh.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
H-hoslive…! Duet…! I-I can see it all in my mind’s eye!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…Will we be working as a pair for everything?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Of course. There’s someone that I absolutely want to pair with you one day, so look forward to that ♪
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Working in pairs… Well, I guess you could make decisions easier that way.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
The pair system also serves as a way for two mayors to reconsider their relationship with each other and form a closer bond.

Although we can work together as a unit, there are some among us who still have problems with others on an individual level.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
(So he wants members who don’t get along to pair up together and get along better…)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Dufufu… Duet… Any combination would be amazing… Ahh, ideas keep popping into my head one after the other…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I-I think that it’s a great idea!

There are, uh… some people who I can’t really conversize with… So it’d be nice if I could do that better…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Oh, that’s not me, then. Does that mean that you wanna team up with people other than me, Renga-san?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Huh, no! I wanna team up with you! I think it’d be really fun…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
(Sigh)... And? Who’s going to be the main host for the first tour?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
If there are any volunteers, I’d love to hear you out.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
……

Um… Could I try hosting the first one?

There’s a large international competition being held soon. I’ll probably be busy with that when the time comes, so I’d like to do mine first before that happens. I’m sorry if that sounds selfish…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
No, it’s quite reasonable. It makes perfect sense why you should lead the first tour in that case.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I agr— Yeah, that sounds good! I, uh, want you to be able to focus on your competitions…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Makes sense to me… So the subhost should be…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
(There’s only one person who comes to mind…)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
What? Why is everyone looking at me?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Umm… My notes, my notes… Ah, it says here that the subhost should be someone who’s not on good terms with the main host!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
(Ahaha… That’s really blunt, Yachiyo-kun. But you’re not wrong…)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Kafka, could you be my subhost? It’d be reassuring having you around.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
………………

…Alright, fine! I came up with the idea in the first place.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
President Oguro and Yukikaze…! The cool-toned beauty duo! Th-th-th-this is gonna be insane…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Well, it looks like we already have things figured out, but I’d like some input before we start the tour. Since HAMA’s still in the beginning stages of revitalization, we all need to learn about other regions’ styles of hospitality.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Does that mean…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
That’s right, we’re going on a study trip!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…Again? Well, I don’t mind if it’s for observation purposes.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
It’s all costs covered, right?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Where are we going?! This time I’ll… I’ll make sure to study up…!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I want the main host to decide on our destination. Yukikaze, do you know where you’d like to go?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…Nagano.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Nagano? Why…? Ah, is it because they held the Winter Olympics there before?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…Sorry. I had the Olympics on my mind, so I said Nagano without thinking.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
This is an important trip, you know?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
But I do actually want to go to Nagano. I’d like to go to the mountains. I think I could find something there…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Mountain climbing? Ugh…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
It wouldn’t be climbing, more like hiking…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Then how about we go to Kamikochi? They have a hiking trail, and I’ve heard that Taisho Pond is beautiful. I’ve been wanting to go there for a while.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…You’ve never been there, Chief?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
No, but I think my family’s all been there, so I’m kinda jealous. I really wanna see the scenery…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Alright, hiking at Kamikochi it is.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Huh?! No, I was just throwing out an idea… We should be going where Yuki-nii wants to go, right?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
I’m okay with Kamikochi. I want to go there more than anywhere else in the world now.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
What, really? Then I guess it’s fine…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…The trail is easy, but we’ll still be walking quite a bit. Will you be alright, Oguro?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…You’re right, I didn’t think about that.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Hmm… I remember that fever you got during our last study trip. Are you sure you’re gonna be okay, Kafka?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Ah, I just looked it up—there’s a bus that goes to Taisho Pond. We could try taking that.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…Don’t wanna.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Kafka?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I’ll walk there. I wanna walk to Taisho Pond myself. I’ve been working on my stamina, so I’ll be fine, okay?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Kafka, you shouldn’t exert yourse—
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Okay, let’s move on! Now that we know where we’re going to go, let’s decide on a date!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
