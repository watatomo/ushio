<Location name="Nagano, Kamikochi - Taisho Pond Bridge" />

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Mmm, the weather’s so nice. So this is Taisho Pond.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
(We finally made it to the day of our trip. Kamikochi… The air here’s so nice and clean.)
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
I’m glad we could go to where you wanted, Yuki-nii. Everyone made it here safely… Although a lot happened on the bus ride…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Yeah, Yachiyo’s luggage kept falling out of the overhead and hitting Renga…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Oww… Why does this happen to me, of all people…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
I’msorryI’msorryI’msorry…! My luggage fell in love with you, Renga-san!! Take this, luggage! You piece of crap!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Woah, it’s way colder here compared to HAMA.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…Tch, my hair’s getting in the way. I should tie it up…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
(It _is_ pretty cold… We’re all dressed for the weather, but I hope that it doesn’t affect Kafka’s health…)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hiker">
Good morniiiing.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Ah, good morning!
</Bubble>

(Jingling)

<Bubble character="Renga">
…Hey, what’s that bell thing everyone’s wearing?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
It’s a bear bell. You put it on so you don’t encounter any bears while hiking.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Bears…?! L-l-l-like, the big scary ones with giant teeth that eat people?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
I don’t think they usually go after humans… But there’s a store right over there that we can all buy bells from.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
I’ll buy out their whole stock…!! Let’s go, guys!! They’ll sell out if we don’t hurry!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…No, they won’t…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Everyone bought different colors… They’re like idol image colors…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Are you sure you’re all good with just one?! I bought enough for everyone, so you should all take five each!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Re-Renga-kun, I think one each is fine.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
(Sigh)… _Bèndàn._
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Huh?! What did you say, Liguang?! I bought some for you, too! I don’t think any bears would like how you taste, but put them on anyway!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
The trail starts here. I’m going on ahead.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Ah, don’t ignore me!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Renga-san, I’ll put the rest of the bells you bought on your bag for you. As long as we all walk with you, the bears won’t bother us, right?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Oh, I see! You’re really smart, Ten. Alright, guys! Make sure to stick with me!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Thaaanks. You’re always so reliable, Renga-san.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
(Ten-kun… He talked his way out of having to wear the bells. But at least Renga-kun feels better now…)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
This is my first time going hiking… I’m so excited. Let’s go, Chief.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Yeah. Oh, right. We should all take a picture together in front of the Taisho Pond bridge!
</Bubble>

<Location name="Nagano, Kamikochi - Hiking Trail" />

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
(It’s a perfect day for hiking. The trees are beautiful, and the sound of the river is so relaxing…)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Chief, the trees around here are so pretty. Are those the Hotaka Mountains in the distance?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
We got really lucky with the weather. Everything here’s so beautiful.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Yeah, these types of experiences are what travel’s all about!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
……

(Kafka’s having a better time out here than I expected him to. Chief looks happy, too. Seeing them smile makes me glad.)

(Loud jingling)

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Renga-san, the sound of those bells is… a little annoying…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Huh? I think they’re helpful… B-but do you really think so? I guess you can’t hear the river over them.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Maybe you should take them off. I don’t think there are gonna be any bears around here. Yachiyo-san will thank you for it. You’re nice and considerate, right, Renga-san?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Urk… Then I’ll just leave three on.

Liguang! Since we’re out hiking, let’s talk a little!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…What is the correlation between those two?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
It’s easier to have a heart-to-heart when you’re out in nature, right? We have to work on our conversizing…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
…”Having a heart-to-heart” won’t change my opinion on you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
HUH?! What does that mean?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
That aside, are you sure you’re okay with _that?_
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
With what… that sign? “Beware of bears…?!”

Ten! Gimme another one of the bells!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Huhh? I don’t think we’ll see any bears… Renga, you’re a pauper just like me, but you’re such a scaredy-cat…
</Bubble>

(Rustling)

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Gyahh, something’s there!!!! I-i-i-it’s a beaaaaaaaar!!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
Uhh, g-g-guys, we gotta run!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
(What?! A bear?! I need to catch up to Renga-kun and Yachiyo-kun…!)

Don’t run, it’s dangerous!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Ah, hold it… Come oooon!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
We’ll have to go after them.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
…Sheesh.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
This is ridiculous…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
But you’re still gonna run after them, aren’t you?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Liguang">
Murakumo… Do you honestly expect me to do that?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Ten">
Ooh, so scaaaary. I’ll go on ahead.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Renga">
(Pant, pant)… W-w-we should be fine now…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Hwayhwauwah…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
Is everyone here? Chief and Kafka are…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…Urgh.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Kafka…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
…I’m fine, Chief. I just tripped.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Really? Thank God…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yukikaze">
…?
