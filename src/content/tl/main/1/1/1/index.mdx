<Narration>
The sun will rise.

Surely it will, no matter how much pain you face or how dark the way ahead seems.

The sun will rise upon a brand new day, and shine on you unconditionally.

And with it will come glimmers of hope.

Take your first step towards it. That one step alone is the beginning of the long journey we call life.

Today is when I took that step.

<Bubble character="News Reporter">
We’re live on the scene here at the HAMA Ward 0 Mayoral Inauguration Ceremony. This is a critical moment for HAMA, as it has been unable to clear visitor quotas for the past two years in a row, leaving many unsure whether it can retain its status as a designated tourism region.

As you can see, many of the locals have gathered here with high expectations for today’s ceremony! We’ll be sure to keep all of you at home updated!

(I can’t believe that they’re airing this on national television… I didn’t know it would be such a big deal, but it makes sense when I think about it. People all over the country are worried about HAMA’s condition right now.)

(Kafka’s gonna be up there today to officially take over as the Ward 0 mayor after his dad… I don’t know how he does it. I’d be worried sick.)

(But still! His operation was a success, and he’s been doing well in post-surgery rehab. Kafka can do this… I know he can!)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Presenter">
Dearest citizens of HAMA, we thank you for joining us for today’s ceremony. Before we start, a few words from the current HAMA Ward 0 mayor, Oguro Rihito, as well as HAMA’s auditor and Tokyo Ward 8 mayor, Shigematsu Hakkei.
</Bubble>

(Applause)

<Bubble character="HAMA Citizen A">
Can you believe they're finally passing the baton? Well… Now that I think about it, our current mayor isn’t the most reliable man around…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="HAMA Citizen B">
But his son is taking over now, right? I heard he’s only 20, so I’m not sure he’ll be any better.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="HAMA Citizen C">
Business hasn’t been great for me since I started losing customers last year… Now if HAMA loses the tourism region title, that’ll be the nail in the coffin for this whole city. Restaurants have already been closing left and right for a couple of years.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="HAMA Citizen A">
Tokyo’s only giving HAMA the absolute minimum amount of financial aid right now… Who knows where things will go now that we’re getting a new mayor.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="HAMA Citizen D">
Tourism region days over… Crazy tax increases… Bankruptcies everywhere… No point in living… Loss after loss after loss…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
(Ugh… Nobody’s in a good mood here… But I can’t say I don’t understand.)

(Kafka’s dad is really nice, but… being a mayor really isn’t his forte. People just kinda walk all over him…)

(I think Kafka could do a better job, but… We only have a year to turn things around. Does he really have a good idea on how to handle all of this?)

(But I’ve decided that I’m gonna stick by his side and work with him to renew HAMA. I’ll finally get to hear what he’s got in mind for the future today. This is important stuff!)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Presenter">
Without further ado, it is my honor to introduce HAMA’s soon-to-be mayor, Oguro Kafka!
</Bubble>

(Applause)

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Thank you for coming out here today, citizens of HAMA. I’m Oguro Kafka, and as I’m sure you all know, I will soon be acting as HAMA’s Ward 0 mayor moving forward.
</Bubble>

(Applause)

<Bubble character="HAMA Citizen C">
That’s practically a grade schooler up there! Geez, Tokyo’s Ward 8 mayor is really staring him down. The kid might as well be gum on the bottom of his shoe.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="HAMA Citizen B">
Well, Auditor Shigematsu is hard to please. Places can lose their status as tourism regions almost instantly because of a single bad review from him…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="HAMA Citizen D">
Crazy stink eye from Tokyo’s Ward 8 mayor… Crazy sudden appearance of unwanted new Ward 0 mayor… Crazy fast degradation of HAMA… Crazy expected tourism region demotion… Crazy hopeless life incoming…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
(Oh no… People don’t trust him at all…! Hang in there, Kafka…)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Ahem. I see there’s some disturbances in the crowd. I don’t blame you. I’d also be worried if someone so young and inexperienced suddenly came into power like this.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Rihito">
Ka-Kafka…? Um, the script says that we should be conducting the succession nice and peacefully. Wh-what’s going on…?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Calm down, Dad. It’ll be fine. No need to panic in front of all of these people.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hakkei">
Hmph. Rihito, it seems to me that your son has no intention of taking his role as mayor seriously. Are you sure he’s fit for this position?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Oh, he’s quite sure, thank you very much. We agreed beforehand to have me succeed as mayor if my surgery went well, so I would appreciate it if you kept out of our family matters.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hakkei">
Oh, is that so? How bold of you to tell me to “keep out” of something that concerns all of HAMA, not just your family.

In case you’ve forgotten, I am the one who decides what HAMA can do with the funds it receives from Tokyo.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Really, now?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="HAMA Citizen A">
What’s going on up there? Things don’t look very friendly…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="HAMA Citizen C">
Current mayor floundering… New mayor fuming… Tokyo mayor unsparing… HAMA done for good…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Presenter">
W-Well then, let us proceed with the succession ceremony! I’ve received the honor of leading the oath for today!

The title of HAMA Ward 0 Mayor, as well as authority over all travel and hospitality industry activities of HAMA-18, currently possessed by Oguro Rihito, will now be passed on to Oguro Kafka—

As the new HAMA Ward 0 mayor, Oguro Kafka will partake in HAMA’s travel and hospitality industry justly under Tourism Law, as well as manage and lead all of HAMA’s ward mayors. Can both parties hereby take this oath?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Rihito">
Oh, we’re… We’re back on track… Yes! I hereby transfer all my current rights as HAMA Ward 0 Mayor.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
I humbly accept the Office of HAMA Ward 0 Mayor.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Presenter">
As Tokyo Ward 8 Mayor and Designated Tourism Region Auditor, Shigematsu Hakkei will inspect and supervise HAMA’s travel and hospitality industry in accordance with Tourism Law and submit the appropriate tourism reviews to the federal government. Can you hereby take this oath?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hakkei">
I suspect that I will be relieved of this role within the year, but I suppose it is my duty as of now. Yes, I swear to conduct a fair and just inspection as auditor.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Oh, you’re leaving us so soon? I guess we’re getting a new auditor next year, then.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Hakkei">
How impudent…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
(This… This is so awkward…! They both have to take it down a notch—everyone here can hear them…)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Presenter">
W-Well, without further ado, it is my honor to welcome our new HAMA Ward 0 mayor!
</Bubble>

(Applause)

<Bubble character="HAMA Citizen B">
I expected him to be just another spoiled rich kid, but… He’s actually pretty plucky, don’t you think?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="HAMA Citizen A">
Maybe we’re in better hands with him than with Rihito…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="HAMA Citizen B">
I heard his late mother was that one famous scientist… He looks just like her.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Yes, well, as the new HAMA Ward 0 mayor, I would like to take the time to present my decisions for HAMA moving forward. To start…

HAMA will no longer be accepting support funds from Tokyo!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
(...Huh?! What in the world are you thinking, Kafka?!)
</Bubble>

(Murmuring)
