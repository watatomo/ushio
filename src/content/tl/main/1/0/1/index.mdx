<Narration>
The memories of a trip are like a cassette tape.

On the A-side are all the fun experiences, and on the B-side…are the tough times that you’ll inevitably have to face. Neither side can exist without the other.

…But even those rough patches are things to love about travel.

Are you recording something with that? Those things haven’t been around in over five decades.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Oh, yeah. It’s a cassette tape.

I think they were used a lot around the end of the 20th century…up until the 90s.

<Bubble character="Kuguri" name="Seatmate">
I’ve heard they’ve been getting popular again lately. People call it “ret,” I think… I’ve been seeing that word around a lot. Are you a fan of ret things?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
I mean, I'm not super into it… but I do really like cassettes.

<Bubble character="Renga" unknown>
HUH?! I’m…bad mood!
