<Narration>
The memories of a trip are like a cassette tape.

On the A-side are all the fun experiences, and on the B-side… are the tough times that you’ll inevitably have to face. Neither side can exist without the other.

…But even those rough patches are things to love about travel.

<Bubble character="Kaede">
…I can’t wait to see you again, Kafka.

<Bubble character="Kuguri" name="Seatmate">
Are you recording something with that? Those things haven’t been around in over five decades.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kaede">
Oh, yeah. It’s a cassette tape.

I think they were used a lot around the end of the 20th century… up until the 90s.

<Bubble character="Kuguri" name="Seatmate">
I’ve heard they’ve been getting popular again lately. People call it “ret,” I think… I’ve been seeing that word around a lot. Are you a fan of ret things?

<Bubble character="Kaede">
I mean, I'm not super into it… but I do really like cassettes.

…plane with you…bad mood…stand and wait…piss me off.

<Bubble character="Renga" unknown="true">
HUH?! I’m…bad mood!

<Bubble character="Kaede">
(What’s going on… Are they arguing?)
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri" name="Seatmate">
Good grief… They’re putting on quite the show.

But it seems like I was able to have a wonderful flight sitting next to you. Thank you dearly, fiú.

Are you coming home to JPN from somewhere?
