Intercom: Please have your arrival card filled out in preparation for our landing.

Intercom: We hope you enjoy the rest of your flight until we arrive.

<Bubble character="Kaede">
The memories of a trip are like a cassette tape.

On the A-side are all the fun experiences, and on the B-side… are the tough times that you’ll inevitably have to face.

Neither side can exist without the other. …But even those rough patches are things to love about travel.

Intercom: We will soon be arriving at Tokyo Metropolis International Airport.

Momiji: …I can’t wait to see you again, Kafka.

Seatmate: Are you recording something with that? Those things haven’t been around in over five decades.

Momiji: Oh, yeah. It’s a cassette tape.

Momiji: I think they were used a lot around the end of the 20th century… up until the 90s.

Seatmate: I’ve heard they’ve been getting popular again lately. People call it “ret,” I think… I’ve been seeing that word around a lot. Are you a fan of ret things?

Momiji: I’m not super into the whole ret thing… but I do really like cassettes.

???: “Hey! …Don’t…move already!”

???: “…plane with you…bad mood…stand and wait…piss me off.”

???: “HUH?! I’m…bad mood!”

Momiji: (What’s going on… Are they arguing?)

Seatmate: Good grief… They’re putting on quite the show.

Seatmate: But it seems like I was able to have a wonderful flight sitting next to you. Thank you dearly, rani.

Momiji: Oh, no, not at all… the pleasure’s all mine!

Seatmate: Are you coming home to JPN from somewhere?

Momiji: Yeah, I’m going back to my hometown. I live in HAMA-18.
